# TinyScheme

_Disclaimer: this repo is not related to original authors, and I have no intention
to take over their fame or their work. It's created rather in attempt to see if
I can understand the project and, perhaps, find a way to help with it._

This is small `Scheme` language implementation written in `C` language to provide
script abilities to C programs or be used standalone. It saw use in some popular
application, among them a plugin for GIMP graphic editor.

It is principally developed as [sourceforge project "TinyScheme"](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyscheme/).

As it doesn't always have great activity there, and as sourceforge (though great resource) doesn't
allow as easy cooperation as github, I took it from there at rev 125 in 
Attempt to bring some refreshing and cleanup.

For now I regard it as playground for myself with goals:

- fix few annoying bugs (most currently open at SF project)
- try creating a set of tests to facilitate development

If the attempt is successful, I'll be glad if anything is reused by original authors or followers.
